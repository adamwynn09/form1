		<h3>Improving Efficiency</h3>
		<p>There are many different ways in which technology and computing has helped make airports
		 very efficient. In 2017, Heathrow airports air transport movemements was just under
		 <strong>1300</strong> a day on average, thus requiring many computing systems to allow the 
		safe arrival and departure of over <strong>200,000</strong> people a day going through the airport.
